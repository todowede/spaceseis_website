# Coastal Shoreline Monitoring Case Study

## Project Overview
Using Sentinel-2 satellite imagery to track coastal erosion and shoreline evolution over time.

## Data Sources
- Sentinel-2 MSI Level-2A products
- 15-year time series (2010-2025)
- 10m spatial resolution
- Monthly temporal resolution

## Methodology
1. **Data Acquisition**: Download Sentinel-2 scenes covering study area
2. **Preprocessing**: Atmospheric correction, cloud masking
3. **Shoreline Extraction**: Automated water/land boundary detection
4. **Change Analysis**: Multi-temporal comparison and trend analysis
5. **Validation**: Ground truth comparison with field measurements

## Key Results
- **Temporal Coverage**: 15-year comprehensive analysis
- **Spatial Accuracy**: Â±2m shoreline position accuracy
- **Study Area**: 50km coastline coverage
- **Erosion Rates**: Quantified annual retreat rates
- **Hot Spots**: Identified critical erosion zones

## Technical Specifications
- **Software**: Python, GDAL, scikit-learn
- **Algorithms**: NDWI, edge detection, change vector analysis
- **Validation**: RMSE < 2m against GPS surveys
- **Processing Time**: Automated pipeline processes monthly updates

## Deliverables
- [ ] Interactive shoreline change maps
- [ ] Temporal analysis charts
- [ ] Erosion rate statistics
- [ ] Risk assessment report
- [ ] Management recommendations
